THIS site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Jekyll. We’ll cover topics such
as getting your site up and running, creating and managing your content,
customizing the way your site works and looks, deploying to various
environments, and give you some advice on participating in the future
development of Jekyll itself.

## So what is Jekyll, exactly???

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template
directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through
a converter (like [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/))
and our [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) renderer, and
spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable
for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine
behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which means you can use Jekyll
to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers **for
free**.
